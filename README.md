# E-commerce Project
### Overview
As part of the project, I carried out an analysis of various aspects of the shop, focusing on both the organizational structure and the shopping behavior of customers. The analysis included a detailed study of sales performance in individual departments and aisles, identifying the most frequently ordered products and assessing the impact of various factors, such as time of day or day of the week, on the number of orders placed.

The project aimed to understand how the shop operates and what purchasing decisions customers make. This made it possible to identify areas with the greatest sales potential and to determine which elements of the offer need to be optimized. The analyses also allowed marketing strategies to be better tailored and more effective loyalty programs to be developed, targeting the most active customers.

The research results provided valuable information that can serve as a basis for more informed business decisions. They will enable better management of the assortment, optimization of operational processes, and more effective adaptation of the offer to customers' expectations, which can ultimately lead to increased sales, improved customer satisfaction, and increased competitiveness of the shop on the market.
### Dataset Used
The dataset contains a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from over 200,000 Instacart users. For each user, between 4 and 100 orders and a list of products purchased in each order are available. In addition, information is provided on the week and time of day the order was placed, as well as the relative time between orders.

### Data Model
![Data Model](https://github.com/DataNeuro/ecommerce-project/blob/main/E-commerce_Data%20model.jpg)


I used Python to create a database with tables: Aisle, Departments, Products, Orders, and Order_products. After setting up the structure, data was loaded into these tables to organize and manage the information efficiently(https://github.com/DataNeuro/ecommerce-project/blob/main/ecommerce_project_final.ipynb).

### Project Overview
In the first part of the project (which covered Queries 1-4), I focused on analyzing data relating to the administrative structure of the store. First, I created a list of departments and the aisles assigned to them and then determined the number of aisles associated with each department. The next step was to make a list of products, the aisles they were assigned to, and the number of products in each aisle. The information gathered in this way provided an accurate visualization of the current layout of the store.

Queries 5 and 6 focused on identifying the users who placed the highest number of orders, which made it possible to develop a loyalty program for the most active customers. In addition, I analyzed a discount program: users with the most orders (first group) receive a 15% discount, the second group 10%, and the third group 5%, while the remaining customers do not qualify for any discount.

In the third part of the project, I focused on a detailed analysis of product sales by department. In Query 8, I carried out an analysis of the number of products sold by department, which allowed me to identify which departments had the highest sales performance. Then, in Query 9, I compared the number of orders placed in each department, comparing the total number of orders with the number of orders placed during the week and at the weekend. This analysis allowed me to assess how different days of the week affect the number of orders in each department, which is crucial for understanding customer buying patterns. As a next step, in Query 10, I identified the department that recorded the highest sales on the weekend. This finding allowed me to conclude the effectiveness of sales at different times, depending on the specifics of the department. In Query 11, I calculated the difference between weekday sales and weekend sales, which enabled me to identify which days of the week were most beneficial for sales in the department. To conclude this part of the analysis, in Query 12, I focused on identifying the ten avenues with the highest number of sales. This analysis allowed me to identify which areas of the shop generate the most shopping traffic and where to focus marketing and operational efforts to maximize sales.

In the fourth part of the project, I focused on analyzing the most frequently ordered products, using different data extraction methods. I carried out this analysis in Queries 13 and 14, with Query 14 providing a more detailed analysis, taking into account additional aspects, which allowed for a more in-depth understanding of ordering patterns. Based on these analyses, I created a list of the 10 most frequently ordered products along with the number of orders for each product. Then, in Query 15, I calculated the average number of orders for each product, which provided a better understanding of their popularity. In Query 16, I compiled a list of the three products that were most frequently reordered, which provided important information about customer loyalty to specific products. The next step was to analyze the products that were not reordered (Query 17), which helped identify potential issues with customer retention or the effectiveness of the offer. In the final part of the analysis, in Query 18, I assessed what percentage of total sales the most frequently ordered product accounted for, which allowed me to identify its impact on overall sales and understand its importance in the context of the overall product offering.

In the fifth part of the project (Queries 19,20 and 21), I focused on analyzing the number of orders to the hours they were placed. I analyzed which hours were the most and least popular in terms of the number of orders. I also focused on identifying the products most frequently ordered in the morning hours. This analysis allowed for a better understanding of customers' daily shopping patterns and the optimization of product offerings and marketing activities according to the time of day.

Finally (Queries 22 and 23), I prepared a summary of key information on products, departments, and aisles. The summary included data on the total number of orders, reorders, average number of products added to the basket, total sales, as well as weekly and weekend sales. I also carried out a comparison between the number of orders of each product and the maximum number of orders in an aisle, which allowed me to identify the products with the highest sales potential in the context of the shop as a whole.

In summary, the analyses carried out provided valuable insights into customer shopping behavior, the popularity of products at different times of the day, and the effectiveness of sales in individual departments and aisles. These results can be used as a basis for further action to optimize the offer, better adapt marketing strategies, and manage the assortment more effectively. The knowledge gained enables more informed business decisions to be made, which can increase sales and improve customer satisfaction.
